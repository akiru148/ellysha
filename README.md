  <!-- Love Letter -->
  <div class="love-letter">
    <h2>To the most special girl, Ellysha,</h2>
    <p>On this day, the world became brighter because you were born ‚Äî and I feel incredibly lucky to know you.</p>
    <p>Every smile you share lights up the room. Every word you say makes my day better. I hope this birthday brings you as much happiness as you‚Äôve brought into my life.</p>
    <p>I‚Äôm really sorry if it ever felt like I was avoiding you. That was never my intention. The truth is‚Ä¶ I care about you more than just a friend, and sometimes being around you gets a little hard when I‚Äôm trying to hide that. But I would never want to hurt you or make you feel unwanted. I just didn‚Äôt know how to deal with everything I feel.</p>
    <p>I also wanted to be honest about something I‚Äôve been holding in: I like you, Ellysha. A lot. More than I‚Äôve let on. I think about you more than you probably know. Your voice, your laughter, your kindness ‚Äî it all means the world to me.</p>
    <p>I know you only see me as a friend‚Äîand I respect that completely. You have every right to choose who you let into your heart in that way. But still, I want you to know that somewhere between the laughs, the messages, and the quiet moments, I started to feel something more for you.</p>
    <p>I never expected anything in return. I just wanted to be honest with myself‚Äîand with you. Loving someone doesn‚Äôt always mean being loved back, and I‚Äôve come to accept that. But loving you has shown me the kind of person I want to be: more caring, more patient, more true.</p>
    <p>So thank you‚Äîfor being someone so genuinely special that my heart noticed. I‚Äôll always be here, cheering for you, even if it‚Äôs just as a friend. Sometimes I see the things you repost about wanting to be loved‚Ä¶ and I just sit there wondering if you even realize how much I already do.</p>
    <p>Maybe yeah, I was nothing to compare with him right? He‚Äôs the first man that made you feel the real love.</p>
    <p>I don‚Äôt want to make this day complicated, just more beautiful ‚Äî so this is a gentle wish and a little confession too. No pressure, no expectations. Just a little piece of truth I wanted to give you.</p>
    <p>I hope today is full of love, surprises, and everything you deserve. And maybe, just maybe, this message makes you smile a little extra.</p>
    <p>Thank you for everything Ellysha, I was enchanted to meet you.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">With all my heart,<br /><strong><span style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Aqil</span></strong></p>
